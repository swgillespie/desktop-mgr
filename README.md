# desktop-mgr - A simple workspace manager.

`desktop-mgr` is a simple workspace manager. It doesn't do a whole lot right now.
I found myself in a mess of folders and projects on my computer and I wanted
to write some Ruby, so I decided to hack one of these up to try and organize
my life a little bit.
